The subdirectories of this directory contain different parts of the 
GridWorldSim platform for simulating grid-based MAS environments.

commons/ contains common classes needed by all GridWorldSim components. Its
only dependency is on log4j which can be found in the generalLibraries 
directory.

server/ contains the GridWorldSim server. It depends on the commons component
mentioned above and also log4j.

serverapi/ contains a Java API that can (and should) be used for
implementing clients that wish to interact with the server. It depends on the
commons component and log4j. 


There are two graphical clients already in existence: One client to
simulate agents "by hand" in order to test the environment that is simulated
by the GridWorldSim server and another client to observe the environment in
detail when a simulation is running. Due to legal issues (the graphical clients
use icons that are released under a non-GPL compatible license) these clients
are currently not part of the tweety project. This will change at a later date
when those icons have either been relicensed or been replaced.

Even though the graphical clients are not necessary to make full use of the
GridWorldSim server, they can ease the development of environments quite a lot.
So if you have an interest in getting the clients now, please drop me an e-mail
to stefan@tittel.net.
