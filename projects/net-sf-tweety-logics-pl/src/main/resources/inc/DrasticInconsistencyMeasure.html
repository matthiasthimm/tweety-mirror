<p>The <i>drastic inconsistency measure</i> $\mathcal{I}_d$ is considered as a very simple baseline approach and is defined as
\[
	\mathcal{I}_d(\mathcal{K})	 = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0 & \text{if~}\mathcal{K}\text{~is consistent}\\ 1 & \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
\]
The <i>drastic inconsistency measure</i> has been discussed in e.g. <a href="#Hunter2010">[Hunter:2010]</a>.
