1. WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains subfolders for all Tweety libraries. These sub folders 
contain the source and Maven project files of the Tweety libraries.


2. CAN I START RIGHT NOW?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No you have to install third party dependencies which are not tracked in the 
central Maven repository to your local Maven repository. Therefore Maven >= 3.0 
as a command line tool is needed. If Maven is installed an invocation of the 
'install_third_party' script for your system installs the dependencies to your 
local Maven repository.

After this step the Tweety libraries are buildable from the commandline using
Maven.


3. PREPARE ECLIPSE FOR MAVEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the usage of Eclispe a version >= Indigo has to be installed. If the 
Eclipse package for Java-Developers is used then the Maven plugin m2e is 
already installed otherwise it has to be installed from the Indigo or Juno 
release update site, choose: 
"Collaboration --> m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse"

Also check "Maven --> Installations" in the Eclipse preferences dialog and use
your external Maven installation.


4. IMPORT MAVEN PROJECTS IN ECLIPSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the Maven integration for Eclipse is installed one can select import 
existing Maven project from the Eclipse ui. When selecting the project folder 
of your local working copy of Tweety the listbox shall show every tweety 
project. Before clicking on finish select advanced and use the name template
'[groupId].[artifactId]'


5. GENERAL TIPS FOR MAVEN IN ECLIPSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If errors occur saying "Project Configuration it not up to date" right click 
onto a project in your package explorer and choose: 
"Maven --> Update Project Configuration" to tell the m2e plugin to rebuild the 
Eclipse project files.
